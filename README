This scroller creates the illusion of a sliding "card deck".  

Its created to allow infinite left/right scrolling through the deck.

It's a work in progress, so for now, it statically adds three labels as the views for each scroll.
So in the future, or if you'd like to add it to the project, you can create some additional functionality 
to allow updating the visible views by use of a data source.
